### Tic Tac Toe exercise

#### Based on MIT's code

Just a couple adjustments (improvements):

* I updated the console.log to correctly print which player filled the square. I used an "intermediary" variable into the console.log to make it work.

* And I would like to prevent a filled square to be modified. I only made use of the state '*filled*' state which was already set at the exercise: *if (!filled)* or *!filled ?*
